Hi Everyone!

I'm Chuck and I'm an Accountant at Ledvance LLC.
Several weeks ago I started this journey by joining W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, CodeAcademy and Internetting is hard.  
As a music composer hobbyist I found it satisfying creating a basic webpage by using coding.
It would be awesome to create/maintain web pages that many people see every day.
I know basic HTML/CSS and plan to learn JS soon so I can contribute and be part of a team!!!!
